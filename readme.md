**An XR biofeedback project for real-time physiological streaming and immersive visualization**

**The Arborist** is a Unity-based XR project that transforms real-time physiological signals into expressive, interactive digital environments. Originally developed on top of Shimmer sensor streaming infrastructure, the project has evolved into a broader platform for embodied biofeedback, immersive installations, and research-driven XR experiences.

This repository contains the full Unity project used for development, experimentation, and deployment.

## ✨ Overview

The Arborist explores how physiological signals (e.g., heart rate, electrodermal activity) can be translated into living digital forms such as growth, motion, and environmental response within immersive XR contexts.

The project supports:

- Real-time biosignal streaming
- Session-based data logging
- Expressive visual mappings
- XR interaction (Meta Quest/OpenXR)
- Research and installation workflows
